% ==================== ABSTRACT ====================
\chapter*{Abstract}
\thispagestyle{empty}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

Sapphire Wallet is a production-grade, non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet application designed for Android devices. In an era where digital assets are becoming increasingly important, the need for secure, user-controlled wallet solutions has never been greater. This project addresses the critical requirement for a multi-chain wallet that provides users with complete control over their cryptocurrency holdings without relying on third-party custodians.

The application supports three major blockchain networks: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tron (TRX), operating on both mainnet and testnet environments. Built using the Flutter framework with Dart programming language, Sapphire Wallet implements industry-standard BIP39 for mnemonic generation, BIP32 for hierarchical deterministic wallet derivation, and BIP44 for multi-account hierarchy.

Key features include secure wallet creation and import using 12-word seed phrases, biometric and PIN-based authentication, real-time portfolio tracking with USD valuation, comprehensive transaction history, QR code scanning for addresses, an integrated address book, and support for multiple wallet accounts. The application emphasizes security through encrypted local storage using Flutter Secure Storage, never exposing private keys to external servers, and implementing secure communication with blockchain networks through established APIs.

The architecture follows the Model-View-Provider (MVP) pattern with Provider for state management, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainable code structure. The application integrates with multiple blockchain services including Mempool.space for Bitcoin transactions, Infura and Etherscan for Ethereum network interaction, and TronGrid for Tron blockchain operations.

This report documents the complete development lifecycle of Sapphire Wallet, including requirement analysis, system design, implementation details, testing procedures, and future sustainability plans. The project demonstrates practical application of blockchain technology, mobile application development, and security best practices in creating a user-friendly cryptocurrency management solution.

\chapter{Introduction}

The rapid evolution of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has fundamentally transformed the landscape of digital finance. Since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has grown exponentially, introducing numerous blockchain networks, digital assets, and decentralized applications. This growth has created an urgent need for secure, reliable, and user-friendly wallet solutions that enable individuals to manage their digital assets without relying on centralized intermediaries.

Cryptocurrency wallets serve as the gateway to the blockchain ecosystem, allowing users to store, send, and receive digital assets. However, traditional custodial wallet solutions, where third parties control users' private keys, present significant security risks and contradict the fundamental principle of decentralization that underpins blockchain technology. High-profile exchange hacks and the collapse of centralized platforms have highlighted the critical importance of self-custody solutions.

Sapphire Wallet emerges as a response to these challenges, providing a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet application that prioritizes security, usability, and user sovereignty. By implementing industry-standard cryptographic protocols and maintaining private keys exclusively on the user's device, Sapphire Wallet embodies the core principles of blockchain technology: decentralization, security, and user empowerment.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Key Components}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{system_overview.png}
    \caption{Sapphire Wallet System Overview}
    \label{fig:system_overview}
\end{figure}

\textbf{1. Wallet Service}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Generates cryptographically secure mnemonic phrases
    \item Derives private keys using BIP32/BIP44 standards
    \item Creates addresses for each supported blockchain
    \item Manages multiple wallet accounts
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Blockchain Service}

    \item Manages price cache
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Flow}

The typical data flow for common operations:

\textbf{Wallet Creation:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User initiates wallet creation
    \item System generates 12-word mnemonic phrase
    \item Derives private keys for BTC, ETH, TRX using BIP44 paths
    \item Generates corresponding public addresses
    \item Encrypts and stores mnemonic in secure storage
    \item Displays mnemonic to user for backup
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Sending Transaction:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User enters recipient address and amount
    \item System validates address format
    \item Retrieves current balance from blockchain
    \item Constructs transaction based on blockchain protocol
    \item Signs transaction with private key (never leaving device)
    \item Broadcasts signed transaction to network
    \item Updates UI and stores transaction locally
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Balance Refresh:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User pulls to refresh or auto-refresh triggers
    \item System queries blockchain APIs for each asset
    \item Fetches current prices from CoinGecko
    \item Calculates USD values for each holding
    \item Updates portfolio total
    \item Refreshes transaction history
    \item Updates UI with new data
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Security Architecture}

Security is paramount in Sapphire Wallet's design:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Private Key Management:} Private keys never leave the device and are stored using Android's secure enclave when available
    \item \textbf{Encrypted Storage:} All sensitive data encrypted using AES-256
    \item \textbf{No Cloud Sync:} Eliminates remote attack vectors
    \item \textbf{Biometric Protection:} Leverages Android's biometric API for secure authentication
    \item \textbf{Transaction Signing:} All cryptographic operations performed locally
    \item \textbf{Network Security:} HTTPS for all API communications
    \item \textbf{Input Validation:} Comprehensive validation of all user inputs
\end{itemize}

This multi-layered approach ensures that user assets remain secure even in the event of device theft, assuming proper PIN/biometric protection is enabled.
